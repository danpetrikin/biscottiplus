			This is where we blah blah on about how amazing we are. To the left is a picture of something pre-sized out. Just replace
			the url form /static/img/logo.png to whatever you use in the upload utility. Sorry, I'm kind of burnt on writing
			copy. I try to be a full service shop best I can, but there's only so many people's jobs I can do :)

			Feel free to go nuts here. Most people who go to this page are actually going to want to read about you. Just make sure
			to break up different paragraphs with different p tags. By the way, this inline styling is terrible coding. This whole site
			is a complete "hack job" and I'd never turn something in this way to a paying client. The python code is somewhat decent,
			but I should really be using forms, validating input, and a bunch of other perfection items.

		Django does allow me to do it
		fairly easily, but I'm basically attempting to gain 30 hours of work that I don't have to do taking short cuts.
		And now that I've hit the length of the divs that float next to each other, I want to break out down here, but still within the main
		div that has the gradient. We use gradients instead of flat colors for asthetic purposes, or however you spell that.

		If you want to make a link to an external site you do it <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">like this.</a> You should probably check
		that site out as well, it's a resource for learning pretty much anything about the basics of site building. Sorry if I came off as a
		jerk saying you wouldn't be able to work directly in the project but it's true. I don't have over a day to sit down and bootstrap if
		I'm not going to get Python help out of it. And, I'm pretty sure you're a Windows user, which is like the biggest PITA to set up.

		First you have to install cygwin, just to mock a unix shell, then of course you need the right version of Python... and no it's not
		the latest version. They royally fucked up with Python 3.x so most devs who know what they're doing use Python 2.7 . Then you've got
		to get your virtual environment tools going, oh wait, you need python setuptools to install that first, then you've got to install
		all the dependencies for the virtual environment in requirements.txt, but some of those will fail because you'll still need to install
		MongoDB and a GCC compiler since we'd be compiling the PIL package. Good luck getting a GCC compiler in Windows correct on the first try.

		After all that's done you'll then need to spend like half a day just learning the basics of Django and how to even run your project. Don't get
		me wrong, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django is an amazing framework.</a> It's the reason I can bang out projects faster than
		entire development teams combined. I know most of the framework inside and out. It's just a very large initial ramp up time in exchange for
		insanity in the productivity level. Honestly, at the pace most engineers move you'd be lucky if they were querying a relational database,
		let alone the NoSQL ones I use since I'm captain bleeding edge technology. But hey, I don't have to rebuild my damn database every time
		I want to change a data model so again, I can write projects as fast as I can edit them, and not be slowed down by silly tools that compile,
		need handholding, or any of the crap that coperation techs shove down your throat.

		But that's enough ranting. If it's not obvious by now, I think this page is a fantastic place to put a wall of text and information. Oh and
		feel free to go nuts and change the content. The image assets I chose were the fastest I could find. I had a feeling you'd want to replace
		the images with ones of your own products anyhow. If you need help photoshopping them just send them over. Lauren's off and owes me some
		dev time anyhow.
